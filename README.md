# Copy the Clock node to your clock model
Copy the Clock node to other clock model, then assign the vertex group for the hands to make any clock model work.

Make sure that when the model's transform rotation is set to zero, the clock face is facing +Z, and the 12 oâ€™clock position and clock hands are facing +Y.
